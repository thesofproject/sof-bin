WARNING: starting with v2.2, older Intel products are not supported by
the main SOF development branch anymore. To avoid duplication and
confusion in this sof-bin git repository, older product generations are
now intentionally MISSING from sof-bin subdirectories v2.x/sof-v2.2/ and
above.

For a complete release that includes all Intel products including older
ones you MUST use official release tarballs found here:

  https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-bin/releases

Installing directly from the sof-bin git repo should still work but it
will only install a subset.

Tarballs are now a combination of several sof-bin subdirectories
generated by a new release script. They include a new manifest.txt
describing that combination. For more details see Github issue #90.

To install the release just perform a recursive copy. You can also try
the convenience ``./install.sh`` script:

```
sudo mv /lib/firmware/intel/sof* some_backup_location/
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/sof-*     some_backup_location/ # optional
sudo ./install.sh v1.N.x/v1.N-rcM
```

Again you don't have to use `install.sh`, you can use any recursive copy of
your preference. This is all what install.sh does, example with
v1.7.x/v1.7:

```
cd v1.7.x
rsync -a sof*v1.7   /lib/firmware/intel/
ln -s sof-v1.7      /lib/firmware/intel/sof
ln -s sof-tplg-v1.7 /lib/firmware/intel/sof-tplg
rsync tools-v1.7/*  /usr/local/bin
```

If you don't want the symbolic links:

```
rsync -a sof-v1.7/       /lib/firmware/intel/sof/
rsync -a sof-tplg-v1.7/  /lib/firmware/intel/sof-tplg/
rsync tools-v1.7/        /usr/local/bin/
```

Remember that for `rsync` (and some versions of `cp`), a trailing slash
in `srcdir/` is roughly equivalent to `srcdir/*` + `srcdir/.??*`  This
is how a recursive `rsync` is always idempotent while a recursive `cp`
is typically not.
